I couldn't find the Conference section in the application in the API, so I pulled content from the “Seminar” and “Sponsor” categories. Since there is no “time” value on the Sponsor side, I didn't divide it into days as Saturday and Sunday. So when I press Saturday, I pull information about Sponsor, and when I press Sunday, I pull information about Seminar. I had finished the application in the office, and when I came home and looked at it again, I realized this deficiency in the API.
